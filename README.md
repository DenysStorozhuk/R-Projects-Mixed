# R-Projects-Mixed
Welcome to the "R-Projects-Mixed" repository! Here, you will find a collection of projects written in R, ranging from basic to advanced levels. Whether you're just starting out or looking to dive deeper into the world of R programming, this repository has something for everyone.

To get started, I want to highlight that basic materials and understanding was based on **Basic Programming in R** and **Advanced Programming in R** courses, which were meticulously curated and presented by Dr. Ramsza. These courses provide a solid foundation and comprehensive understanding of R programming concepts, allowing you to develop your skills and confidence.

In addition to the projects and courses, I will continuously update this repository with valuable resources that I come across during my own learning journey with R. These sources will provide further insights and practical examples to enhance your understanding and proficiency in this incredibly useful language.
